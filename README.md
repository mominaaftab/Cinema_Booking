# Cinema_Booking
Cinema booking allows users to reserve seats for a movie at a chosen time. It includes selecting a film, viewing showtimes, picking available seats, and confirming tickets, often with online payment. The system offers convenience, real-time seat status, and reduces waiting time at theaters.
